## What is 11-Plus Exam
[ 11-Plus ](https:// )exam is U.K based program for students who wants to continue their studies in State Funded grammar school

## Purpose
This project inteneds to create a mobile app for the student who decides to take an 11-Plus exam in U.K in order to join the grammar school. Those who pass this exam join that grammar school and continue  their secondary school studies there.

## Language to Use
I don't  intend to use Java for android Platform or Objective c or Swift for Os Platform or any Windows specific language. On the other hand my intention is to use  "html" , "JavaScript" , "BootStrap"" , "CSS" and "JQuery" using JQuery-Mobile taking some help from JQuery-UI.

To produce a platform specific code I intend to use "Cordova" .

Any help , a piece of advice or suggestion will be most apperciated.
